# FireEliminationSystem
System created for MECH498 (Senior Design Practicum) to detect and eliminate household fires.

The OpenMV camera sends information from the fire to a Raspberry Pi to control servos for pan-tilt actuation and to send an image to a household occupant's email. Later code will be added to control a nozzle's angle, sound an alarm, read a distance sensor, and to pump fire supressant.
